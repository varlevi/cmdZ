            <p>Our society is shaped by the technology we use, and possibly the most influencial aspect of technology is one simple command. <code>cmd+z</code>.</p>
            <p>Think about it. How often do you make a decision without thinking about the implications of that choice? How often do you do something thinking you'll be able to, if things go wrong, back out of it, or <b>undo</b> it?</p>
            <p>It is undisputed that people of the modern age are much more temporal than those of the past, but the fact of the matter is, descisions still impact the world the same way they used to.</p>
            <p>If only people would think before they acted. If only people were reminded of the importance and perminance of every choice they make. Think of how many problems would be solve by NEVER HAPPENING.</p>
            <p>This is where cmdZ comes in. The concept examines what technology would look like if it tried to replicate reality and remove any way to "undo" the user's actions.</p>

                <h2>Setup</h2>
                <p>Getting started with cmdZ is incredibly easy and it introduces the user to everything different about the OS.</p>
